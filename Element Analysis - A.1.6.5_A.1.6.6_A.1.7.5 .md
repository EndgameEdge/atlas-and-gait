## #1

### Target Document - A.1.6.6 and A.1.7.5

> "All FacilitatorDAOs must immediately either support the action or propose overturning it and penalizing the FacilitatorDAO when an operational security breach derecognition is initiated. Failing to act is itself misalignment and results in penalties for all the FacilitatorDAOs that failed to act."

"Element": "immediately"

"Analysis": "The term \"immediately\" refers to a period within 24 hours following a specific event, excluding weekends."

## #2

### Target Document - A.1.6.5:

> "AD are generally not allowed to engage directly with Ecosystem Actors and other counterparties to the DAO, or in other ways engage in operational activities. They must remain focused on their job of using their physical voting power over the protocol to safeguard its alignment. Additionally, they must publicly provide governance information and research material to AVC, and can interact with ecosystem participants for this purpose. They are also not allowed to provide \“kickbacks\” from their compensation to MKR holders that delegate to them. Any violation of these requirements constitutes breaching the Alignment Conserver requirements."
Element: "generally not allowed"

"Analysis": "The statement \"AD are generally not allowed\" means that they are restricted from performing the specific action unless explicitly permitted by the Artifacts or if abstaining would result in harm to the DAO."

## #3

### Target Document - A.1.6.5:

> "If a FacilitatorDAO finds that an AD has performed a misaligned act or breached their requirements, they can derecognize the AD and confiscate their AD Buffer. The AD Buffer can be used as a whistleblower bounty in case an ecosystem actor provided useful data, information or evidence that led to the derecognition of the AD. GOV6 must specify sufficient safety mechanisms around the payment of the whistleblower bounty."
Element: "sufficient safety mechanisms"

"Analysis": "The term \"sufficient safety mechanisms\" refers to measures designed to prevent manipulation that could unjustly deprive the reporter of the whistleblower bounty. This includes situations like allowing the AD to voluntarily resign to their role with the intent of preserving their buffer amount."
