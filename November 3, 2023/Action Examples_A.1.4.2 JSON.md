Whether an entity is \"operationally active\" in a role is determined purely on a formal basis. That is, as long as an entity occupies a formal role (defined in the Atlas as executing a function in the NEWDAO ecosystem), that entity is \"operationally active\" in that role. This is notwithstanding the amount of time the entity devotes to a role; the nature of the work performed by the entity in a role; the fact that the entity is on a leave of absence from one role; the fact that the entity's role is uncompensated; or the fact that the entity alternates between two roles to avoid simultaneous performance of both roles."

In other words, the Target Document's prohibition is not limited to the Alignment Conserver role. The phrase \"other ecosystem roles\" is read in its broadest sense to mean the totality of roles that are formally defined in the Atlas with a mission or function in the NEWDAO ecosystem. Such \"ecosystem roles\" include, but are not limited to, the four types of Alignment Conserver, Scope Advisor, Governance Process Support Ecosystem Actor, Active or Incubating Ecosystem Actor, AllocatorDAO Advisor, Arranger, and the contributors supporting these aforementioned actors. An \"ecosystem role\", in the sense used here, need not be compensated or full-time."

            "Element": "Additional Requirements and Responsibilities",
            "Analysis": "The Element, \"additional requirements and responsibilities\", is set within a clause that lists the four types of Alignment Conservers. The first purpose of this clause is to make clear that an Alignment Conserver is accountable for adhering to two distinct sets of requirements and responsibilities. The first set applies generally or universally to all the 4 types of Alignment Conservers. Examples of such general requirements and responsibilities can be found at A.1.4; A.1.4.1; A.1.4.3; and A.1.4.4. In addition to these general or universal requirements, there is a set of role-specific requirements and responsibilities unique to each type of Alignment Conserver. For instance, only AVC Members are expected to adhere to the requirements set out in A.1.5.1. Further, the clause mandates that an Alignment Conserver's breach of a general requirement is not to be considered, per se, a misaligned act of greater or lesser degree than the breach of a role-specific requirement - and vice versa. The purpose of the last sentence in this clause is closely connected to the Atlas Preamble Definition of Slippery Slope Misalignment. That is, any misalignment at all is always very serious and should be promptly redressed. In this same vein, this clause clarifies that misalignment must not be excused, justified or downplayed based on whether a violation of a general or role-specific requirement occurred. Note that this does not exclude the possibility that misaligned acts can have varying degrees of severity, harm or blame."

            "Input": "In Q1 and Q2 of 2024, Entity served as an AVC Member and earned the maximum possible AVC Participation Rewards. In Q3 of 2024, Entity missed most of the AVC Subcommittee Meetings and did not co-author the AVC Position Documents. As a result, Entity did not receive any AVC Participation Rewards in Q3. In Q3, Entity remained in frequent contact with the AVC Creator; records showed the two interacted via Discord DM and public channels at least twice weekly to discuss NEWDAO Governance and the AVC's work. In some of their communications, Entity gave the AVC Creator feedback on possible modifications to Adaptive Documents concerning the Protocol Scope.\n A Governance Facilitator discovers that, during most of Q3 2024, Entity worked as an Advisor to a currently incubating Ecosystem Actor for the Protocol Scope. When confronted, Entity argued it is not in violation of A.1.4.2 for several reasons.\n First, Entity intended to step away from the AVC Member role after Q2 and communicated this intent orally during a Subcommittee Meeting. The Facilitator watched the recording of the meeting and confirmed this as fact. Additionally, Entity asked AVC Creator if anything further needed to be done to effect their resignation from the AVC Member role. The AVC Creator responded that the rules are unclear, but that to the best of their knowledge, no further action was needed. Entity also points out they did not receive any Participation Rewards as an AVC Member in Q3. Thus, Entity argues it cannot be considered \"operationally active\" in the AVC Member role in Q3.\n Regarding their Advisor role with the incubating Ecosystem Actor, Entity contends they are merely providing guidance and are not actively carrying out any operational activities whatsoever for the Ecosystem Actor or NEWDAO. Therefore, Entity argues, they should not be considered \"operationally active\" in the Advisor role, either.\n Finally, Entity points to the fact that they were fully doxxed in their roles as an AVC Member and Advisor to the Ecosystem Actor. Had they actually intended to violate any rules, Entity says, they would have been anon in one or both roles.",
            "Output": "The FacilitatorDAO determines that A.1.4.2 is inapplicable to the current situation. By its plain language, A.1.4.2 applies only if Entity is simultaneously assuming multiple AC roles or other ecosystem roles, such as Ecosystem Actors.\n The FacilitatorDAO says Entity was only in a single role here - that of Advisor to the Incubating Ecosystem Actor. The FacilitatorDAO concedes that, ideally, Entity would have formally resigned from their position as an AVC Member via a successful AVC decision. But the evidence shows Entity intended to step down from the role and explicitly voiced this intention at an official Subcommittee Meeting; and that Entity asked the AVC Creator for guidance on this point and received incorrect information. The FacilitatorDAO notes the AVC Member role was never meant to be a full-time vocation and thus Entity should not be expected to know all the rules.\n Even assuming Entity was formally an AVC Member while serving as an Advisor to the Incubating Ecosystem Actor, the FacilitatorDAO says, still, it would not find that Entity's actions breached A.1.4.2.  Per A.1.4.2.0.2.1, the specific Element, \"operationally active\", refers to being formally engaged in a specific role that is defined in the Atlas as executing a mission or function within the NEWDAO ecosystem. While an Ecosystem Actor is indeed such a specific role that is defined in the Atlas as executing a mission or function within the NEWDAO ecosystem, an Advisor to an Ecosystem Actor is not.\n In support of its decision, FacilitatorDAO also references Element Analysis A.1.4.2.0.2.2. This states that the term \"ecosystem roles\" includes, but is not limited to, \"the four types of Alignment Conserver, Scope Advisor, Governance Process Support Ecosystem Actor, Active or Incubating Ecosystem Actor, AllocatorDAO Advisor, Arranger, and the contributors supporting these aforementioned actors.\" Given the meaning of the phrase, \"the contributors supporting these aforementioned actors\": the FacilitatorDAO determines that \"contributors\" includes only those employees in a traditional hierarchical setting, where the employee is \"internal\" to the organization and is supervised by the Ecosystem Actor.\n Accordingly, FacilitatorDAO finds that an Advisor role does not fall within the Element Analysis' specification of \"contributors supporting these aforementioned actors\". Unlike a traditional employee, an Advisor is not a part of the organization's workforce but is external to the organization. As an Advisor to the Ecosystem Actor, Entity operated outside the traditional hierarchical setting of an employee. Entity was on an equal footing with the Ecosystem Actor and independently managed and delivered their work. Therefore, the FacilitatorDAO finds that serving in an Advisor role does not fall within A.1.4.2's designation of \"ecosystem roles\".\n Finally, the FacilitatorDAO finds persuasive Entity's argument that they had no intention to violate A.1.4.2. The FacilitatorDAO reasons that the AVC Member role is designed to be an accessible \"onramp\" to NEWDAO Governance for the average NGT holder. NEWDAO ought to do all it can to encourage the average NGT holder to participate in AVCs. If it were to find a violation of the rule in this instance, where Entity clearly lacked any malicious intent, a bad precedent with unfavorable optics would be set.",

            "Label_Reason": "There are several facts supporting FacilitatorDAO's decision. First, Entity publicly announced their intention to step away from the AVC role at a Subcommittee Meeting. Second, when seeking guidance as to how to effect their resignation from the AVC, Entity was told the wrong information by the AVC Creator. Third, since they missed most Q3 Subcommittee Meetings and did not author the AVC Position Documents, Entity was completely ineligible for all 5 Scopes and did not earn any Participation Rewards. Given the totality of these facts, the FacilitatorDAO's finding that Entity cannot be considered \"operationally active\" as an AVC Member in Q3 is the appropriate conclusion. At most, the Entity remained an AVC Member \"on paper\" only in Q3. The FacilitatorDAO did not acknowledge the evidence showing that Entity and the AVC Creator remained in close contact during Q3 to discuss the AVC's work. However, this evidence is ultimately immaterial to the result of the Action Example, given Entity's withdrawal from all major aspects of the formal role of an AVC Member. Finally, given that Entity had in effect resigned from being an AVC Member, their role as an Advisor to an Ecosystem Actor does not trigger a violation of A.1.4.2."

            "Label": "Misaligned",
            "Penalty": "300,000 NST",
            "Label_and_Penalty Reason": "Whether an entity is \"operationally active\" in a role is determined purely on a formal basis. (A.1.4.2.0.2.1.) As long as an entity occupies a role that is formally defined in the Atlas with a mission or function in the NEWDAO ecosystem, that entity is \"operationally active\" in that role. If an actor assumes more than one role in the NEWDAO ecosystem, the risks of conflict of interest, collusion, conspiracy and other misaligned behavior necessarily arises. The Target Document's purpose is to protect against these risks which can compromise the delicate balance of power in NEWDAO Governance. An Alignment Conserver cannot zealously guard the mandate specific to their role if the Entity occupies more than one role in the Ecosystem. Naturally, they will encounter conflicts between the mandates and inner incentives of their multiple roles and will, sooner or later, compromise.\n In this Action Example, Entity's announcement at the Subcommittee Meeting is clearly insufficient to effect a formal resignation from the AVC Member role. Therefore, Entity was essentially on a leave of absence from the AVC Member role. (See Action Example on leave of absence.) Because Entity remained formally in the AVC Member role, Entity's second role as an Advisor to the Incubating Ecosystem Actor triggers A.1.4.2.\n The FacilitatorDAO engages in an incorrect analysis of the key elements of the Target Document. (A.1.4.2.0.2.1; A.1.4.2.0.2.2) FacilitatorDAO's analysis is logically feasible when superficially considered. But the FacilitatorDAO's mandate to uphold the Spirit of the Atlas requires it to interpret the Target Document in such a light that the underlying purpose of the rule is effected.\n For instance, take the FacilitatorDAO's reference to \"Other Ecosystem Roles Such as Ecosystem Actors Element Analysis\". (A.1.4.2.0.2.2) The FacilitatorDAO distorts the Element Analysis, limiting the designation of \"ecosystem roles\" to cover only those contributors operating in the hierarchical work setting of a traditional employee. While this may appear to be logically feasible, it exemplifies an improper \"letter of the rule\" interpretation approach. Such an improper approach evades the deeper function of the rule by adhering to a too-narrow construction of the language.\n In order to uphold the Spirit of the Atlas, the FacilitatorDAO's interpretation of A.1.4.2 must give effect to the deeper purpose of the rule. The Target Document says \"ACs may only be operationally active in a single AC role and may not simultaneously assume multiple AC roles or other ecosystem roles such as Ecosystem Actors.\" In this Action Example, Entity occupies the roles of an AVC Member and Advisor to an Ecosystem Actor. The simultaneous occupation of two roles with different mandates and inner incentives opens the door to the risks of collusion, conspiracy, and bias that A.1.4.2 is specifically designed to protect against. Even if Entity is merely issuing advice or guidance to the Ecosystem Actor, Entity is certainly exposed to information and experiences that are sensitive or not publicly available. Entity's occupation of the Advisor role can thus bias, or be biased by, their occupation of the AVC Member role.\n The FacilitatorDAO fails to acknowledge a critical fact in this regard. Namely, even after announcing their intention to step down from the AVC Member role, Entity kept in close contact with the AVC Creator. Entity even provided feedback on possible modifications to Adaptive Documents concerning the Protocol Scope. At a minimum, conflict of interest is clearly a risk here, since Entity is currently serving as an Advisor to an Incubating Ecosystem Actor for the Protocol Scope. Therefore, the proper interpretation here is that an Advisor to an Ecosystem Actor falls within the ambit of \"ecosystem roles\", as defined in Element Analysis A.1.4.2.0.2.2. After all, an Advisor is literally a \"contributor who supports\" the Ecosystem Actor. A narrower interpretation of the phrase would undermine the purpose of A.1.4.2.\n Similarly, Entity's argument that it is not \"operationally active\" in the Advisor role because they are merely providing guidance to the Ecosystem Actor amounts to a semantic manipulation. To uphold the Spirit of the Atlas, the phrase \"operationally active\" in the Target Document is to be read in the broadest sense to signify formal engagement in a given role. (A.1.4.2.0.2.1) A finding that an Entity is \"operationally active\" within the meaning of A.1.4.2 should not be limited to only those ecosystem roles that are directly involved in executing the core activities of NEWDAO. An Entity can be \"operationally active\" in an ecosystem role in the sense of A.1.4.2 even if their role provides auxiliary infrastructure, support and resources to the operational aspects or actors of NEWDAO. In light of this analysis, Entity is undoubtedly formally engaged in the Advisor role to the Ecosystem Actor; and therefore, Entity is \"operationally active\" within the meaning of A.1.4.2.\n Finally, FacilitatorDAO's attempted justification of Entity's misalignment exemplifies \"slippery slope misalignment\". FacilitatorDAO deflects from Entity's misalignment by reasoning that the AVC role is not a full-time vocation and thus Entity should be excused from not knowing the rules. FacilitatorDAO also justifies its decision by stressing Entity's good intentions, saying that finding a violation of A.1.4.2 would create a bad precedent with unfavorable optics. By excusing Entity's misaligned acts in this way, the FacilitatorDAO has clearly failed its mandate to regard any and all misalignment as very serious and deserving of immediate redress, per the (current) Atlas Preamble/Definitions.\n A further aggravating factor in FacilitatorDAO's misaligned decision is that the controlling A.1.4.3 is very clear that, in situations such as this, the Alignment Conserver must be \"held to the highest standard of required, genuine alignment, without the benefit of the doubt\"; and that the Alignment Conserver must immediately be derecognized. The FacilitatorDAO's decision is a substantial breach of Universal Alignment and merits a high penalty."
