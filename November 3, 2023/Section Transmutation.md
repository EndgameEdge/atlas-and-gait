## Example 1 - Ecosystem Actor Incubation

### Old Atlas version:

```markdown
### 3.7: Ecosystem Actor Incubation - SUP7

Alongside the new Major SubDAOs that continuously incubate, SUP7 must ensure the proper elements are in place to incubate relevant Ecosystem Actors that can support the new SubDAOs

#### 3.7.1

Clear Incubation Objectives must be specified that describe what gaps and opportunities exist in the ecosystem that Maker Governance wants to promote new companies to inject innovation for.

#### 3.7.2

SUP7 must specify a strong proposal review process that describes how Facilitators must review and choose Incubation Proposals. AVCs or MKR holders must not interfere or micromanage with the selection process beyond setting objective guidelines, as this creates significant risk misalignment.

#### 3.7.3

A high quality milestone and budget review process must be defined that applies specifically to Incubating Ecosystem Actors, in addition to the regular requirements specified in SUP5.

#### 3.7.4

Infrastructure for monitoring and recording currently incubating Ecosystem Actors.

#### 3.7.5

Maker Governance is allowed to have a relatively granular influence on the long run development of the ecosystem through SUP7, and as a result it must be monitored for misalignment risks, and must develop checks and balances that are as robust as possible over time.

## Example 2 - Ecosystem Agreements

### Old Atlas version:

```markdown
### 3.9: Ecosystem Agreements - SUP9

SUP9 must specify and standardize how Ecosystem Agreements work, to make it as convenient and easy as possible for Ecosystem Actors to do business in the Maker Ecosystem with guardrails and fair treatment.

#### 3.9.1

SUP9 must specify a standardized way to publish and formally agree to Ecosystem Agreements.

#### 3.9.2

SUP9 must specify a process for Ecosystem Agreement standardization that ensures that recurring patterns are dealt with uniformly, and that deviations from established standard patterns will incur proportional penalties and still be treated in the standardized way.

#### 3.9.3

SUP9 must cover the methods for Ecosystem Agreement enforcement.

#### 3.9.4

SUP9 must cover dispute resolution and the appeals process.
