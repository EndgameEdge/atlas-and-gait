# Element Analyses - A.1.4.2

```
Guidelines:

Element Analysis Documents analyze and interpret individual elements in a Main Document, 
breaking down the meaning, implications, and applications of these elements 
to provide a clear and comprehensive understanding of the Main Document's content.

The Analysis Component should contain the 
interpretation, implications, and applications of the Element, 
providing a detailed understanding of its role and meaning in the Target Document 
in the broader context of the Spirit of the Atlas.

Make the implicit, explicit.

### Target Document - A.1.4.2

> "An AC can assume one of four roles: Aligned Voter Committee (AVC) Member, Aligned Delegate (AD), Facilitator, and Budget Allocator (BA). ACs may only be **operationally active** in a single AC role and may not simultaneously assume multiple AC roles or other ecosystem roles such as Ecosystem Actors. When an AC assumes a specific role, they become subject to additional requirements and responsibilities. Breaching these role-specific requirements and responsibilities is misalignment equivalent to breaching the general AC requirements."

"Element": "operationally active",

"Analysis": "The Element, \\"operationally active\\", is set within a clause that prohibits an Alignment Conserver from simultaneously occupying more than one formal role in the NEWDAO ecosystem. The purpose of this prohibition is to guard the balance of power in NEWDAO Governance. If actors are able to assume two or more roles simultaneously in the ecosystem, then the effort to balance the distinct governance powers or dynamics is foiled. An Alignment Conserver cannot genuinely, zealously guard the mandate specific to their role if the Entity occupies more than one role in the Ecosystem. Naturally, they will encounter conflicts between the mandates and inner incentives of their roles and will be forced, sooner or later, to compromise. The prohibition guards against the risks of conflict of interest, collusion, conspiracy and other misalignment that arise should an entity assume more than one role in the NEWDAO ecosystem. The specific Element, "operationally active", refers to being formally engaged in a specific role that is defined in the Atlas as executing a mission or function within the NEWDAO ecosystem. Whether an entity is "operationally active" in a role is determined purely on a formal basis. That is, as long as an entity occupies a formal role (defined in the Atlas as executing a function in the NEWDAO ecosystem), that entity is "operationally active" in that role. This is notwithstanding the amount of time the entity devotes to a role; the nature of the work performed by the entity in a role; the fact that the entity is on a leave of absence from one role; the fact that the entity's role is uncompensated; or the fact that the entity alternates between two roles to avoid simultaneous performance of both roles."

"Element": "other ecosystem roles such as Ecosystem Actors",

"Analysis": "The Element, \\"other ecosystem roles such as Ecosystem Actors\\", is set within a clause that prohibits an Alignment Conserver from simultaneously occupying more than one role in the NEWDAO ecosystem. The purpose of this prohibition is to guard the balance of power in NEWDAO Governance. If actors are able to assume two or more roles simultaneously in the ecosystem, then the effort to balance the distinct governance powers or dynamics is foiled. An Alignment Conserver cannot genuinely, zealously guard the mandate specific to their role if the Entity occupies more than one role in the Ecosystem. Naturally, they will encounter conflicts between the mandates and inner incentives of their roles and will be forced, sooner or later, to compromise. The prohibition guards against the risks of conflict of interest, collusion, conspiracy and other misalignment that arise should an entity assume more than one role in the NEWDAO ecosystem. The specific Element, "other ecosystem roles such as Ecosystem Actors", clarifies that the Target Document's rule is violated if an Entity formally occupies two NEWDAO ecosystem roles of whatsoever kind. In other words, the Target Document's prohibition is not limited to the Alignment Conserver role. The phrase "other ecosystem roles" is read in its broadest sense to mean the totality of roles that are formally defined in the Atlas with a mission or function in the NEWDAO ecosystem. Such "ecosystem roles" include, but are not limited to, the four types of Alignment Conserver, Scope Advisor, Governance Process Support Ecosystem Actor, Incubating Ecosystem Actor, AllocatorDAO Advisor, Arranger, and the contributors supporting these aforementioned actors. An "ecosystem role", in the sense used here, need not be compensated or full-time."

> "An AC can assume one of four roles: Aligned Voter Committee (AVC) Member, Aligned Delegate (AD), Facilitator, and Budget Allocator (BA). ACs may only be operationally active in a single AC role and may not simultaneously assume multiple AC roles or other ecosystem roles such as Ecosystem Actors. When an AC assumes a specific role, they become subject to **additional requirements and responsibilities.** Breaching these role-specific requirements and responsibilities is misalignment equivalent to breaching the general AC requirements."

"Element": "additional requirements and responsibilities",

"Analysis": "The Element, \\"additional requirements and responsibilities\\", is set within a clause that lists the four types of Alignment Conservers. The first purpose of this clause is to make clear that an Alignment Conserver is accountable for adhering to two distinct sets of requirements and responsibilities. The first set applies generally or universally to all the 4 types of Alignment Conservers. Examples of such general requirements and responsibilities can be found at A.1.4; A.1.4.1; A.1.4.3; and A.1.4.4. In addition to these general or universal requirements, there is a set of role-specific requirements and responsibilities unique to each type of Alignment Conserver. For instance, only AVC Members are expected to adhere to the requirements set out in A.1.5.1. Further, the clause mandates that an Alignment Conserver's breach of a general requirement is not to be considered, per se, a misaligned act of greater or lesser degree than the breach of a role-specific requirement - and vice versa. The purpose of the last sentence in this clause is closely connected to the Atlas Preamble Definition of Slippery Slope Misalignment. That is, any misalignment at all is always very serious and should be promptly redressed. In this same vein, this clause clarifies that misalignment must not be excused, justified or downplayed based on whether a violation of a general or role-specific requirement occured. Note that this does not exclude the possibility that misaligned acts can have varying degrees of severity, harm or blame. (The language here can be improved to reduce ambiguity.)"
