## Example 1
### Old Atlas version:

#### 2.5.2: Aligned Governance Strategies and Aligned Scope Proposals

The core task of AVCs is the quarterly creation of an up to date ratified Aligned Aligned Governance Strategy and up to date ratified Aligned Scope Proposals for each of the 5 Scopes.

##### 2.5.2.1

The Aligned Governance Strategy is a document that instructs ADs in how to vote with the votes of their Governance Strategy Link to the specific AVC.

###### 2.5.2.1.1

The first paragraph of the Aligned Governance Strategy is the AVC Profile, which can be up to 280 characters long. The AVC Profile is displayed in the EGF and other important Maker Governance interfaces when describing the AVC. AVCs must have easy to understand Profiles, and their governance actions must be congruent with their AVC Profile. The AVC Profile must, as its first sentence, describe where the AVC aims to be on the Hawk, Dove, Balanced spectrum.

###### 2.5.2.1.1.1

Hawkish AVCs tend to prefer higher spreads and lower budgets, focusing more on short term income and asset accumulation. Dovish AVCs tend to prefer lower spreads and higher budgets, focusing more on long term growth and innovation. Balanced AVCs try to find a middle ground between the two. The Hawk, Dove, Balanced spectrum is a continuous spectrum, so many different hawkish or dovish AVCs can exist that are more or less Balanced.

##### 2.5.2.2

The Aligned Scope Proposals are documents that describe the desired updated state of each of the Scope Artifacts. The Aligned Scope Proposals are often created based on a starting point developed by Scope Advisory Councils, where the AVCs then apply and communicate their unique strategic perspective.

##### 2.5.2.3

For Aligned Governance Strategy and Aligned Scope Proposals to be valid, they must be posted on the AVCs communication channels, and have a hash of its contents ratified through a successful AVC Decision.

##### 2.5.2.4

AVCs must always be able to articulate their Strategic Perspective in their AVC Profile in a simple enough way that EGF users can reasonably understand what delegating their votes to the strategy of the AVC means. This is in terms of the Aligned Governance Strategy and the Aligned Scope Proposals that the AVC will create.

## Example 2
### Old Atlas version:

#### 2.4.4

If an Alignment Conserver is discovered to act against the requirements outlined in *2.4.2* and its subelements their Alignment Conserver status must immediately be derecognized by the FacilitatorDAOs. GOV4 must specify the processes for derecognition so that they are fair and minimize risk for the Maker Ecosystem.

##### 2.4.4.1

In cases of mild “slippery slope” breaches, a warning may be given and recorded in the Governance Artifact with no further consequence for the first breach.

##### 2.4.4.2

In severe cases that can be described as Governance Attacks, in addition to being derecognized, the Alignment Conserver is also stripped of all reputation recognized in reputation systems of the Scopes.

##### 4.3.6.2: Free NFT Farming

This mode of farming embeds tokens into the users free NFT that is not lockstaked in the relevant lockstaking engine. The amount of tokens embedded are reduced by an amount equivalent to half of the relevant lockstaking exit fee.

##### 4.3.6.3 Lockstaked Token Farming

This mode of farming gives the user tokens that are lockstaked in the tokens native lockstaking engine.

## Example 6
### Old Atlas version:

#### 4.3.9: Allocator Lockstake Engine

Each Allocator is incubated with a native Allocator Lockstake Engine. The Allocator Lockstake Engine enables users to lock up their AllocatorDAO tokens or NFT embedded with AllocatorDAO tokens.

##### 4.3.9.1

The Allocator Lockstake Engine is usually accessed through an EGF, and using it requires that the AllocatorDAO tokens are delegated.

##### 4.3.9.2

When lockstaked the AllocatorDAO tokens farm the AllocatorDAOs MiniDAO tokens. The MiniDAO tokens can be farmed as free tokens, free NFTs, or Lockstaked NFTs.

##### 4.3.9.3

The Allocator Lockstake Engine has an exit fee of 25%, when AllocatorDAO tokens exit the Allocator Lockstake Engine 25% of the tokens are transferred to a yield boost pool that provide self-farming farming for the Lockstake Engine users by transferring 1% of its contents per day as self-farming directly embedded into the Lockstaked NFTs of the Allocator Lockstake Engine users.

## Example 7
### Old Atlas version:

#### 4.3.12: AllocatorDAO Emissions

AllocatorDAOs have a genesis token emission that occurs over the first 10 years of its existence, and an additional permanent emission that continuously occurs forever.

##### 4.3.12.1: AllocatorDAO Farm Distribution

70% of all AllocatorDAO tokens emitted for farming are for Dai farming, and 30% of all AllocatorDAO tokens emitted for farming are for Sagittarius Engine users.

##### 4.3.12.2: AllocatorDAO Genesis Emissions

The Genesis emissions of Allocators are 2.3 billion tokens over 10 years, with the following breakdown.

For the final 4 years, the rate of Genesis farming is 62.5 million AllocatorDAO tokens per year.

###### 4.3.12.2.2

The workforce bonus pool starts with 300 million AllocatorDAO tokens. The Workforce bonus pool can be further topped up through the permanent emissions.

##### 4.3.12.3: AllocatorDAO Permanent Emissions

The permanent emissions of AllocatorDAOs are a total of 10% tokens emitted per year.

###### 4.3.12.3.1: Permanent MiniDAO Axon Emissions

5% of the total supply is emitted per year for the MiniDAO Axon.

###### 4.3.12.3.2: Permanent Farming Emissions

3.75% of the total supply is emitted per year as farming emissions

###### 4.3.12.3.3: Permanent Workforce Bonus Pool Emissions

1% of the total supply is emitted per year as workforce bonus pool emissions, if the workforce bonus pool contains less than 5% of the total supply of AllocatorDAO tokens.

## Example 8
### Old Atlas version:

#### 4.3.19: The Budget System

The Budget System is a protocol module that enables token holders to set up budgets associated with Scopes, based on the specifications in the relevant Scope. The budgets that can both be controlled manually by the token holders through executive votes, but also can be accessed by FacilitatorDAOs that have been assigned FacilitatorDAO Responsibility to the Scope that covers the budget, and the FacilitatorDAO is able to delegate access to the budget to smart contracts that can in turn be controlled by Facilitators and be given specific restrictions and security measures.

##### 4.3.19.1

When multiple FacilitatorDAOs have assigned Responsibility for the same Scope, their control of its fixed budgets are split in half. Additionally, each FacilitatorDAOs budget access can be increased through the Budget Allocation System, which will increase the accessible budget only for the specific FacilitatorDAO that is receiving Allocated Budget.

## Example 9
### Old Atlas version:

#### 4.4.2: The Trigger Mechanism

The Trigger Mechanism is a technically isolated smart contract on the target chain that uses zero knowledge proofs to allow MKR holders from NewChain to prove they are “end-holders” (not delegates or validators) of MKR. A minority of MKR end-holders from NewChain can delay the actions of the Validators, or trigger the Fallback Multisig. The parameters for delaying actions and triggering Fallback are determined by PRO4, and must be continuously updated and reassessed.

##### 4.4.2.1

When using the Trigger Mechanism, the MKR holders become vulnerable to slashing in case they abuse the power to attack the system with no legitimate reason.
